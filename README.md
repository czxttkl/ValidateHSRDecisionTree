ValidateJsonDecisionTree
========================

Usage
--------------------------------------
* Download `hsr.jar`: https://db.tt/onEEoTfa
* Execute 

```bash
java -jar hsr.jar <n> <k> <q> {<-s "json_string"> | <-f json_file_path_name>}
```

* `n`: rungs
* `k`: jars
* `q`: questions
* `-s "json_string"`: input your json string manually
* `-f json_file_path_name`: import your json string from a file


Example
--------------------------------------
```bash
java -jar hsr.jar 9 3 4 -s "{"decision_tree":[4, [2, [1, {"h":0}, {"h":1}], [3, {"h":2}, {"h":3}] ], [6, [5, {"h":4}, {"h":5} ], [7, {"h":6}, [8, {"h":7}, {"h":8}] ] ] ]}"
```

or

```bash
java -jar hsr.jar 9 3 4 -f test.json
```

HSR Reference

JSON Notation Norms
--------------------------------------

The grammar and object structure would be in an EBNF-like notation:

```bash
DTH = "{" "\"decision_tree\"" ":" <dt> DT.
DT = Compound | Leaf.
Compound = "[" <q> int "," <yes> DT "," <no> DT "]".
Leaf = "{" "\"h\" " ":" <leaf> int "}".
```

Example
--------------------------------------

```json
 // h = highest safe rung or leaf
{ "decision_tree" :
[1,{"h":0},[2,{"h":1},[3,{"h":2},{"h":3}]]]
}
```


Validation
--------------------------------------
A decision tree in DT for HSR(n,k,q) must satisfy the following properties:

* the BST (Binary Search Tree Property): For any left subtree: the root is one larger than 
the largest node in the subtree and for any right subtree the root is equal to the smallest 
(i.e., leftmost) node in the subtree.

* there are at most k yes from the root to any leaf.

* the longest root-leaf path has q edges.

* each rung 1..n-1 appears exactly once as internal node of the tree.

* each rung 0..n-1 appears exactly once as a leaf.
